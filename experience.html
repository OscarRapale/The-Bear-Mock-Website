          <p>
            Our tasting menu features 8 to 10 thoughtfully crafted courses,
            built around proteins from both land and sea, along with seasonal
            vegetables, fruits, grains, and nuts. The menu evolves regularly
            based on what’s fresh and in season, and every dish is prepared
            with precision and purpose.
          </p>
          <p>The full experience typically lasts between 2 and 2½ hours.</p>

          <p><span style="font-size: 24px">Wine & Drinks</span></p>
          <p>
            A curated wine pairing is available to complement the flow of the
            tasting menu. We also offer a focused selection of wines by the
            glass or bottle, along with classic cocktails and a small,
            considered beer list.
          </p>
          <p>Our team is happy to help you choose the right pairing.</p>

          <p>
            Due to the nature of our menu, we’re unable to make substitutions
            for personal preferences or general aversions. However, with at
            least 72 hours’ notice, we can accommodate certain dietary
            restrictions and mild allergies, including:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Seafood allergies</li>
            <li>Tree nut/peanut allergies</li>
            <li>Pregancy-related restrictions</li>
            <li>Pescatarian</li>
            <li>
              Lacto-ovo vegetarian diets (please note: egg, gelatin, and dairy
              cannot be removed)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These accommodations must be requested in advance via the pre-visit
            questionnaire sent after your reservation. Unfortunately, we cannot
            make last-minute changes on the day of your visit.

          <p>
            Please note that while we take great care in handling allergens, we
            cannot guarantee an entirely allergen-free environment.
            Cross-contact may occur in our kitchen or through our supply chain.
            If you or a guest in your party has a severe allergy that could be
            triggered by trace amounts, we recommend reaching out to us prior to
            booking.

          <h2>The Bear's Bar</h2>
          <br />
          <p>High Craft. Low Key.</p>
          <p>
            The Bear's Bar isn’t about white tablecloths or quiet corners. It’s
            a bar built on great cocktails, lively conversation, and a laid-back
            atmosphere that feels genuinely Chicago. The music’s good, the
            mood’s easy, and the drinks are crafted to be felt, not just
            admired.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Located right next door. No reservations needed, walk-ins always
            welcome.

            Located in the heart of Chicago, our kitchen is built on chaos,
            craft, and community. From the clatter of prep to the silence of a
            perfect plate. We serve with intention. Whether you're a regular or
            it's your first time, you're part of the family now.
            <br />
            Every second counts. Every plate matters.
